        When it comes to minimalist style, it’s not necessarily what you wear,
        but how you wear it. <br />
        Take the quiet luxury fashion trend, for instance. It's the latest
        example of how a less is more <br />
        approach to dressing can earn you major sartorial clout. Celebrities
        have been championing <br />
        the look for years thanks to its timeless nature and wearability.
